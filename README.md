# FireSlides
An experimental slides-based UI for live blogging built with Firebase and Reveal.js

FireSlides is an experimental slides-based UI for live blogging that is built using Firebase and the Reveal.js library. The idea is that readers can flip through live blog posts in a more immersive manner.  At the same time, if readers prefer a regular scrolling interface, that is available as well.  Because the app is built using Firebase, updates are immediately synced to any client connected to a particular deck.

A live version of the editor can be found at https://fireslides.herokuapp.com/. Simply sign up using either your Google or Twitter account to start creating "decks" for each live blog.  An example of a public deck can be found here: https://fireslides.herokuapp.com/decks.html?id=-KBVB5yv55yn-nSIXBTh
